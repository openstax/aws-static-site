Description: >
  Identities needed by both primary and replica buckets for the <%= prose_site_name %> web site

Resources:

  # There are two ways for CloudFront to access content in an S3 bucket.  One has the
  # buckets configured with website endpoints and CloudFront hits the buckets as custom
  # origins.  The other method connects CloudFront to the buckets using an "origin access
  # identity" (OAI).  When we use a primary and replicated failover bucket in the CloudFront
  # configuration (via an origin group), then per https://goo.gl/M2Dru3 ...
  #
  # > If you use two S3 buckets in your origin group and you use OAI, both buckets
  # > must be set up with the same OAI.
  #
  # Because of the difficulty of sharing information between stacks across regions,
  # we use this stack to make the OAI so its value can be given to the two stacks that
  # control the primary and replica buckets.
